PythonAtWork (py@Work) has been created to share knowledge about using Python programming language to solve common problems at work. The two main ideas for initiating this project are:

## 1. Learning to program with Python
Python is a high level programming language which is widely used and liked by a large community. Some of the main reasons behinid its popularity and success are its easy to read and write sytax. Python is said to be a very developer friendly language and hence becomes a good tool for the beginners to learn how to code. Beginners do not need to worry a lot about the unnecessary details of the language and can concentrate on learning to code. 
With this idea this repoository (repo in short) will cover the basic fundamentals of the language which are required for a programmer to start using Python.
 
## 2. Using Python at Work (Share common use cases)
As mentioned above Python is a user friendly and easy to learn language. This is just one of the reasons for its widespread adoption by both academia as well as the professional world. Another major reason for its widespread popularity are the utilities or modules that have been created and shared by its community. Python's ever growing community keeps contributing to the large corpus of reusable code. In Pythonic way this reusalbe code is called module or package(a collection of modules). The Python community keeps adding these code bits to a large corpus/index from where anyone can download and start using these. 
Some of the most popular packages which you might have heard of are pandas for data guys, numpy for math operations, scipy for scientific community, matplotlib for those who love charts, scikit learn for data scientists and tensorflow steaming hot among machine learning enthusiasts. This is just a small pick from the largely popular set of packages. There are alot many which are widely used.
While being excited looking at this pandoras box of unlimited possiblities with Python, we also aim to collaborate and share some of these possibilities on this platform. This can be used as a place to share some of the most common use cases where Python can be our best friend. Such use cases can be really helpful to solve our day to day problems at work.  

## Our Audience:
1. Beginners to both programming and Python
If you are an absolute beginner to programming you could use this as a resource to learn how to program. A part of this repository is dedicated to learning programming with Python. The section mixes tutorials about fundamentals of programming and basic constructs of Python required to program. 
2. New to Python but have some programming experience
For the people who have some background in programming we welcome you to the world of Python. The tutorial will walk through the fundamental building blocks of the language which are pretty much similar to any major programming language. So it should not take long for you before you can start creating those cool applications with Python. 
3. All those who want to learn how Python can help at work
This repo has a dedicated section to collaborate and share use cases around Python. We aim to provide tips, tricks and usage of some of the most widely used Python packages. The aim is to gather as many useful examples which can really be of help for solving our common problems at work.   

## How this works?
This is a collaborative platform which is open to content and suggestions from all the readers. The content can be used and shared with anyone without any permission from it's creator. Please feel free to share content for improving tutorials and keep adding to the never ending section of use cases. Use cases section is a section where a lot of community sharing would be required as we all have come      

The material will be shared using Jupyter/Ipython notebooks. Jupyter notebooks have become a vastly popular way of sharing code, research content, documentations and learning material. It is a tool using which you can create and share rich documentation all with workable code. The user can run the code while reading through the documentation which explains the flow of the code. Hence we will also use Jupyter/ipython notebook to share majority of our content. For those of you who are not familiar with Jupyter this will be an additional learning. 
We will cover more about installation and usage of Jupyter notebook at the beginning of the turorial section.
