Python is a high level interpreted programming language which is used for general purpose programming. One needs to have a Python run time environment installed on the machine in order to execute execute Python programs. 
Python has two major versions commonly called as Python2 and Python3. Python version 2.7 was the last version for Python 2 version series. Python 3.6 is the latest major version for Python 3. Before the Python 3 versions were release 2.7 was a widely used version and still a lot of code created in 2.7 still exists. Python 3 was created with a lot of improvement and addition of new features to the language. Hence 3 is the way to go for the future of Python. Hence we will also provide all our code in Python 3. Majority of the code should still be compatible with version 2.7 but there might be a few things which might not work well. 

So many people have already done wonderful work to share Python knowledge. As part of this project we would use those resources wherever applicable rather than reinventing the wheel. 

##Installation instructions:
Depending on the operating system you are using you might need to install Python on your machine. If you are a mac or Linux user your operating system should already have Python installed. 
To check if you already have Python installed follow the following instructions:
  1. Open terminal on mac/linux  or command prompt on Windows operating system
  2. type the below command to get version of Python installed on the machine
 Â     python --version
      
The above command should return the version of Python installed on the machine. As shown in the above example the output from the command provides Python 3.5.2 which is the current version of Python installed on the machine.
If you don't see the version and command returns an error message that means that Python is not installed on your machine.
Most of the Windows users should face the issue as Windows does not come pre-installed with Python. Please follow the following instructions to install Python on Windows system:

The above link is just a quick reference for installation which explains installation in a simpler way through screenshots. You could refer to any other resource for installation if you are unable to follow this resource. 
Another common way of installation Python and managing other packages in it is by using Anaconda distribution. Anaconda is an open source distribution which consists of Python and multiple python libraries for common data science and machine learning use cases. Anaconda is free to use for any personal or academic purpose. There is also enterprise version available for commercial use. Please refer to the official website of anaconda to get more details on it.
